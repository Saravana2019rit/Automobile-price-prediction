# AUTOMOBILE PRICE PREDICTION:

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
      
      Cleaned the data by removing the normalized losses column since it has a large number of missing values and remove some rows which have empty values Split data(75% for training the model and 25% for testing)After that selected Linear Regression model train that model.

# AZURE SERVICES USED:
      
      Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model. In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks. The final output will be visualized in the evaluated model
